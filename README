Rough Draft for sequence comparison with Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
Usage: compareSequence([array of integer to compare],[array of integer to compare])

Current Issue: Tend to minimize errors

TODO:
1) User interface to read data file line by line directly.
2) Modification to Needleman-Wunsch to allow calculating edit distance instead of optimal alignment (which tends to minimize error).
